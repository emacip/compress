Implement two methods to perform basic string compression/decompression ,
e.g. aaabbccc will compress to a3b2c3 and vice-versa. You can assume the input is only letters.
If the compressed string did not become smaller then return the original string.
Provide some tests to cover these methods.

Another example; a11b2 would become aaaaaaaaaaabb
